# Project Blueprint

## Overview

This project is a modern e-commerce application built with Angular. It features a clean, user-friendly interface and leverages the latest Angular features for optimal performance and a reactive user experience.

## Style, Design, and Features

### Current Version

*   **Standalone Components**: The entire application is built using standalone components, directives, and pipes.
*   **Reactive State Management**: Signals are used for all state management, ensuring a highly responsive and efficient application.
*   **Modern Control Flow**: The new built-in control flow syntax (`@if`, `@for`, `@switch`) is used for more readable and intuitive template logic.
*   **Optimized Change Detection**: All components use `ChangeDetectionStrategy.OnPush` to minimize unnecessary re-renders and improve performance.
*   **Firebase Integration**: The application is connected to Firebase for backend services, including authentication.

### Key Features

*   **Login Page**: A dedicated login page allows users to authenticate with their email and password.
*   **Registration Page**: A new registration page allows users to create a new account.
*   **Authentication Service**: An `AuthService` handles all authentication logic, including sign-in, sign-out, and user state management.
*   **Registration Service**: A `RegistrationService` handles the user registration logic.
*   **User Model**: A `User` model defines the structure for user data throughout the application.
*   **Routing**: The application uses the Angular router for navigation, with dedicated routes for the login and registration pages.
*   **Styling**: The application features a modern design with a clean layout, balanced spacing, and a professional color scheme.

## Implementation Plan

### Phase 1: Create Login Page and Connect to Firebase Auth

1.  **Create `blueprint.md`**: Outline the project structure, features, and implementation plan.
2.  **Generate Login Component**: Create the `LoginComponent` with its HTML, CSS, and TypeScript files.
3.  **Add Login Route**: Add a route for the `LoginComponent` in `app.routes.ts`.
4.  **Create `AuthService`**: Implement an `AuthService` to handle user authentication with Firebase.
5.  **Define User Model**: Create a `User` model to represent user data.
6.  **Update `app.config.ts`**: Import and provide the necessary Firebase modules for authentication.
7.  **Add Navigation Link**: Add a link to the login page in the main `app.html` file.
8.  **Build and Verify**: Run `ng build` to check for any compilation errors and ensure the application is working correctly.

### Phase 2: Add User Registration

1.  **Create `RegistrationComponent`**: Create the HTML, CSS, and TypeScript files for the registration component.
2.  **Create `RegistrationService`**: Implement a service to handle user registration with Firebase Authentication.
3.  **Add Registration Route**: Add a route for the `RegistrationComponent` in `app.routes.ts`.
4.  **Add Navigation Link**: Add a link to the registration page in `app.html`.
5.  **Build and Verify**: Run `ng build` to ensure the new feature is integrated correctly.
